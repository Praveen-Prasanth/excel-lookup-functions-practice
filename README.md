# 🔍 Excel Lookup Functions Practice

This project contains an Excel workbook where I practiced and applied different types of lookup functions in Excel. These functions are essential for data searching, referencing, and dynamic calculations in spreadsheets.

## 🧠 What’s Covered

This practice file includes examples and exercises on:

- `VLOOKUP`
- `HLOOKUP`
- `XLOOKUP`
- `INDEX + MATCH`
- `LOOKUP`
- `IFERROR` combined with lookups
- Relative vs Absolute referencing

Each function is demonstrated with clear scenarios using sample data tables to retrieve values based on conditions or positions.

## 📁 File Included

- `Lookup.xlsx` — The main workbook containing all lookup function examples and results

> All exercises are solved and annotated inside the file for clarity.

## 📌 Why This Project?

As part of my learning in Excel data handling, I created this file to:
- Understand how each lookup function works
- Compare the usage and flexibility of old and new Excel lookup formulas
- Build a habit of writing clean and effective Excel formulas

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (365)
- Built-in formula functions
